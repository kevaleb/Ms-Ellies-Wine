I've just gotten back from a trip to Southern California to the Ramona AVA wine region, and in general the area around Sand Diego. &nbsp;Interesting, enlightening experience. &nbsp;The best part was meeting with wine makers and hearing their experiences. &nbsp;These people are passionate, hardworking, savvy, amazing people. &nbsp;At each interview I met a person who loves the world of wine and wants to share it. &nbsp;I'm sitting across from Susanne, the owner of Vineyard Grant James and I felt I was meeting a good friend for the first time. &nbsp;She talked about her journey that led her to making wine. &nbsp;I was struck by her dedication to her dream, the REAL person she is, and the lovely hospitality given our Winery Guild Team. &nbsp;I wanted to sit on her patio and drink wine with her and talk about...everything. &nbsp;Thank you Susanne for the interview and the great time.

Vineyard Grant James makes a Sangiovese that is delicious. &nbsp;I brought a bottle back home with me and pair it with Steak Oscar. &nbsp;It was a GREAT pairing. &nbsp;I was surprised because I did't think Sangiovese would pair with such an elegant dish. It did! Now, a little fact I was reading the other day about Sangiovese... &nbsp;American Sangiovese tends to be a bit "bigger" with softer acidity. &nbsp;So that translates into the color being darker, and more rich fruit on the palate than it's sister Italian varietal. &nbsp;Try it! if you haven't. &nbsp;And I definitely recommend Vineyard Grant James's Sangiovese. &nbsp;Delicious!
