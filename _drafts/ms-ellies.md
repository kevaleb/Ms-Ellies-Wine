I'm at the M Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. &nbsp;I was laying in my hotel bed this morning, having slept in, and was contemplating whether to stay there all day or get up and find a cup of coffee. &nbsp;The room was almost completely darkened and my thoughts were meandering along similar paths. &nbsp;I'm turning 48 in a few days. &nbsp;I'm okay with the number of years I've seen. &nbsp;I've earned my age. &nbsp;And I wouldn't go back to 20-something for anything. &nbsp;But life goes through challenging cycles. &nbsp;2016 has brought me some challenges. &nbsp;And I was laying in my bed this morning wondering if I'm meeting these adequately enough, fear and anxiety were pressing like a weight on me.&nbsp; As I was laying there with my sodden, heavy thoughts, my phone dings with a text message. &nbsp;I contemplated whether to pick it up or not. And decided to.

...It was a text from a friend. &nbsp;A young man I know who is, at the moment, traveling in Europe. &nbsp;He texted me to tell me that he was sitting drinking wine in Florence, Italy at that moment and was thinking of me. &nbsp;Among other endearing sentiments he expressed, he thanked me for "bringing so much class and culture to our community". &nbsp;This touched me deeply. &nbsp;And my cloudiness lifted and I got up to go find coffee. Isn't friendship and human connection wonderful? &nbsp;And at the oddest moments, when you feel most alone, light finds you. &nbsp;Thank you friend.

I'm presently sitting in the coffee lounge at the M drinking a hot latte and people watching. &nbsp;It's one of my favorite things to do in a busy public place. &nbsp;Vegas is an often sought "destination" for those wanting to vacation. &nbsp;I live 2-3 hours away and can come any time I want so I probably take it a bit for granted. &nbsp;But I really don't get why it's such a "hot, sought after" destination. &nbsp;I don't like the casino scene. &nbsp;Every once in a while, it's nice to go to a show and catch a few drinks and a nice dinner. &nbsp;But the gambling, the atmosphere, the scramble for "glitz", big money walking around, fake boobs, swaggering men, ...it's a part of Vegas I just don't like. &nbsp;To come hang out in a casino all day playing slots or the tables just doesn't cut it for me. But, I admit, I'm in town to go to The Australian Bee Gees tonight. &nbsp;I'll put on my "sparkle", slip on the little black dress, black heels, slather on the lip gloss, pop a bottle of champagne before show time, and definitely enjoy myself. &nbsp;One thing that can be said for Vegas is FUN, pan on having it....Oh, and shopping. &nbsp;If you decide to come to Vegas, plan on shopping to go with the gambling. &nbsp;You won't regret it. And I find I have something left after my efforts.

On that note... since shopping is a must, I'll be shopping wine. My birthday's coming up and besides, I can't go into the holiday season ill prepared. &nbsp;It just won't do, will it?&nbsp; ;) &nbsp;There's a few bottles I've been wanting to check out so.... &nbsp;Wish me luck and happy shopping.&nbsp; \*Cheers\*
