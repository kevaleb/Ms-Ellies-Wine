The wine pairing for Beach House turned out great. &nbsp;I have to admit though, my ego is a bit bruised. &nbsp;I decided to put an invite out on Facebook for 4-6 guests with the stipulation they were agreeable to be filmed. &nbsp;I thought my messenger would be inundated with lots of people wanting to participate and I'd have to do a sort of lottery to choose who would attend. &nbsp;NOT. &nbsp;\*Sniff\* &nbsp;I had to beat the bushes for people who were willing to participate. &nbsp;I did have one person private message me, agree to come, then renege. &nbsp;Hmph. I guess being on film isn't all it's cracked up to be. But, in the end, I got a nice group who really enjoyed the event and were glad they got to taste the wine. &nbsp;My cheese and wine were all delicious. &nbsp;I was impressed, again, with the quality of the wine

Beach House Winery is one of a handful of wineries in Oceanside, California. &nbsp;They bring in most of their grapes, with only a small percentage grown on their property. The Winery Guild team spent several hours interviewing, filming, visiting and of course, tasting wine. &nbsp;It was a highlight of the trip. George and Kim were delightful hosts. &nbsp;The closing hour spent on the rooftop at Beach House, sipping wine, looking at the magnificent view and visiting with George about the nuances and challenges of the wine business in Southern Cali.

And yes, I bought wine....their Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to be exact. &nbsp;So, when it came time to taste the wines, I decided to do a wine and cheese pairing. &nbsp;I bought a variety of cheeses to accommodate the selection of wine I had and I wasn't disappointed.

The evening went well, the pairing were a success and once again, my opinion that people just enjoy connection is reinforced. &nbsp;If I can experience this with wine and social events, I'm satisfied. &nbsp;
