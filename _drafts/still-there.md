Today, I woke with the thought in mind of how wine is so indicative of life. &nbsp; Take, for example, some of the best wines in the world. &nbsp;They are dry farmed. &nbsp;In fact, it's considered "a crime" to irrigate the vines. &nbsp;The lack of water forces the vine's roots to dig deep to find nutrients and water, therefore promoting a strong root system. &nbsp;Less water makes for more pungent, dense flavored grapes. &nbsp;And so the LACK of water actually makes the vines stronger, more vibrant, and the wine that comes from these grapes is superior. &nbsp;So it seems to be with life. &nbsp;We go through times of deep struggle, deprivation, and pain. &nbsp;And it's these moments, days, and years that forge a person with strength, compassion, insight, and ability to connect with fellow human beings. &nbsp;THIS is another reason I love wine. &nbsp;It goes through rigorous process to produce a final product that is beautiful in expressions of where it came from and the forging it endured to be a "great" wine. &nbsp;

I've been silent for a bit. &nbsp;Life gets crazy and real. &nbsp;But, with all that, I woke today, feeling grateful for it all, and with this analogy in my head. &nbsp;Tonight, I'll be celebrating nothing but the end of the week with a friend. &nbsp;I'll be contributing my hands as cook help and a bottle to the occasion (still deciding which one). I'm happy to be able to have these simple joys to look forward to. &nbsp;I hope, reader, that wherever you are, you have these same joys that feed your life. &nbsp;Peace out.
