This coming Friday our Winery Guild team is doing a wine tasting with the wines I purchased from the Beach House Winery in Oceanside California. &nbsp;We'll be tasting their Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. &nbsp;Kim and George are hospitable, friendly, open and love making wine and educating others about it. I'll do a follow up article after the tasting. &nbsp;I'm excited to be introducing this winery to you all. &nbsp;This is a definite visit if you find yourself in the Oceanside Cali area. &nbsp;Kim and George have built a beautiful, quaint property that offers a respite away from the busy hubbub of the Cali coast. &nbsp;George knows what he's doing when it comes to red wine. &nbsp;I had such a delightful few hours visiting and gleaned some great information about the area and challenges of making wine in the Southern California wine regions. &nbsp;Thank you George and Kim for the interview and for hosting such a pleasant time!&nbsp; \*Cheers\*!
