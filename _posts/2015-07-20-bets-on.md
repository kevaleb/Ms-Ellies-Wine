I was at a party for my sister. &nbsp;She hosted an all day "open house" event and invited her children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters. &nbsp;I wasn't able to go until after I was finished with work and my daily workout, so I arrived (rather late) at 7:30. My sister told me that people were bringing their drink of choice. By the time I got there everyone had had plenty of sparkling wine, white wine and beer. (I was definitely "behind the times".) The menu was cheese, bread and caprese salad. So, naturally, I brought a red wine....Zinfandel to be exact. &nbsp;It was an Elyse, Korte Ranch 2007 Zinfandel. Delicious! &nbsp;I shared it with several people, including this Guy, John. &nbsp;He said he liked it. &nbsp;And the others who had a glass expressed how much they liked it. &nbsp;This Guy, John had brought a couple bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon, Pine Ridge 2012. &nbsp;Delicious also!! &nbsp;(I always say there's nothing that beats a well made Cab.) &nbsp;Anyway, I also brought a Beaulieu Vineyards Tapestry, 2011, which is a red blend. One of my favorite bottles. &nbsp;(I have many, many favorite bottles...not to appear fickle ![](/uploads/versions/3679441a-1ad5-4516-b605-c00596753ce9---x----1600-1064x---.jpg)or anything but...there's so much GREAT WINE OUT THERE!) &nbsp;So...a couple hours later, we'd enjoyed the Zinfandel and BV Tapestry and the Pine Ridge was being sipped and savored..and discussed. &nbsp;This Guy, John had made several jabs at me about Zinfandel and finally commented that he didn't like Zinfandel. &nbsp;I asked if I had made a mistake by sharing with him the Zin I brought and he says, "Oh, no. That was good." This sparked a conversation between us about Cabernet and Zinfandel. &nbsp;(I'm thinking, "I've had this argument before...with other people!) &nbsp;With him insisting that almost any bottle of Cabernet is better than a bottle of Zinfandel. &nbsp;He insulted Zinfandel quite roundly and so what could I do but de-
