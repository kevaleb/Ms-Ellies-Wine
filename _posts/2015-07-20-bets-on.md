I was at a party for my sister.  She hosted an all day "open house" event and invited her children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters.  I wasn't able to go until after I was finished with work and my daily workout, so I arrived (rather late) at 7:30. My sister told me that people were bringing their drink of choice. By the time I got there everyone had had plenty of sparkling wine, white wine and beer. (I was definitely "behind the times".) The menu was cheese, bread and caprese salad. So, naturally, I brought a red wine….Zinfandel to be exact.  It was an Elyse, Korte Ranch 2007 Zinfandel. Delicious!  I shared it with several people, including this Guy, John.  He said he liked it.  And the others who had a glass expressed how much they liked it.  This Guy, John had brought a couple bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon, Pine Ridge 2012.  Delicious also!!  (I always say there's nothing that beats a well made Cab.)  Anyway, I also brought a Beaulieu Vineyards Tapestry, 2011, which is a red blend. One of my favorite bottles.  (I have many, many favorite bottles…not to appear fickle ![](/uploads/versions/3679441a-1ad5-4516-b605-c00596753ce9---x----1600-1064x---.jpg)or anything but…there's so much GREAT WINE OUT THERE!)  So…a couple hours later, we'd enjoyed the Zinfandel and BV Tapestry and the Pine Ridge was being sipped and savored..and discussed.  This Guy, John had made several jabs at me about Zinfandel and finally commented that he didn't like Zinfandel.  I asked if I had made a mistake by sharing with him the Zin I brought and he says, "Oh, no. That was good." This sparked a conversation between us about Cabernet and Zinfandel.  (I'm thinking, "I've had this argument before…with other people!)  With him insisting that almost any bottle of Cabernet is better than a bottle of Zinfandel.  He insulted Zinfandel quite roundly and so what could I do but de-
