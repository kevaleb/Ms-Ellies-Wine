This summer, I had several things that I buried myself in, the play, Steel Magnolias, being one, and my 30 year class reunion being another.  Then I've been working on my new start up business, Winery Guild.  Back in mid May, I tried out for the play Steel Magnolias.  I got the part and the past 3 months, I've been focused on that plus my class reunion.  I just finished the production this past weekend.  It got a LOT of good reviews and it was expressed by many that I did very well with my character development, consistency with my southern accent, and that my dimples "rocked".  The dimples are debatable, but I was really stoked to actually be on stage sharing such a delightful script with the audience.  I had to put the rest of my life on the back burner (including wine buying and tasting) while I focused on the play.  But, I'm getting back on track again and look forward to concentrating more of my energy here.

This summer I've gotten into white wine more than I ever have before.  As I've mentioned before, I am definitely a red wine fan.  But as I have experienced a wider and wider circle of wine, my appreciation for white wine has blossomed into a very cordial "like" relationship.  I want to recommend, for a "go to" white, Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc.  I've had the '12, '13, '14, and now, '15.  The '15 is by far my favorite so far.  I've enjoyed the other vintages, but the 2015 Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc not only has the fresh crisp acidity of the citrus fruits, grapefruit being at the forefront, but on the back palate, there's a mellowing roundness and softening of subtle buttery peachy fruit flavors. Yummy!  Makes my mouths water thinking about it.  This wine is affordable, quality, and easy to stock up since it's widely available.  Try some if you want to branch out from Chardonnay.  \*Cheers\*
