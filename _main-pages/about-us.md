Born out of our love of fine wines and delicious food, Ms Ellie's Wine Guide to the Universe has become the net's #1 fun place to land and learn about wine.  Ms Ellie became passionate about wine and how to enjoy it many years ago.  When she would attend parties, she would feel "inferior" because of her lack of experience with wine and the wine "gurus" didn't consider her "worthy" of the fine wine behind the bar.  When she visited wineries, it seemed that the world of wine was filled with sophisticated wine connoisseurs who spoke a language she didn't begin to understand and whose opinions were the only ones that mattered.   Feeling overwhelmed and a bit shunned by this world, but still intrigued by and loving wine, Ms Ellie decided to learn wine on her own.  She began buying wine online and learning for herself what was good and what was ok--what was great and what was OVERPRICED.  Ms Ellie is now sharing her expansive experience in wine with all of you.

When it comes to wine, Ms Ellie has it for you:
*  Daily Specials
*  Pairings
*  Tasting Tips
*  Recipes
*  The perfect wine experience
.....and much, much more!
